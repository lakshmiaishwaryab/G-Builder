Our task was to develop a comprehensive suite of tools for student life management, encompassing a test score tracker, attendance management system, expense tracker, and deadline reminders. Employing a frontend stack comprising HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, we prioritized simplicity and user-friendliness in design.
In the test score tracker, students can visualize their performance across various tests via a line graph, with the flexibility to input test numbers and corresponding scores. The expense tracker facilitates budget management, allowing students to record both budget allocations and expenditures, which are categorized based on user-defined signs.
The attendance management system streamlines the tracking of student attendance. Through inputting student and class details, users can monitor attendance statuses, distinguishing between absences, presences, and leaves.
Additionally, our solution includes deadline reminders, ensuring students remain organized by tracking impending deadlines and removing them upon completion. Leveraging JavaScript for backend functionalities, we have strived to create a cohesive and efficient system to enhance student productivity and organization.
Our project mandate entailed the creation of a multifaceted student life management system comprising a test score tracker, attendance management module, expense tracker, and deadline reminder functionality. Leveraging a frontend stack consisting of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, we emphasized a minimalist design ethos for enhanced usability.
